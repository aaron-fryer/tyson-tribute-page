          Here's a time line of Tyson Fury's life:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1988</strong> - Born in Manchester, England</li>
          <li><strong>1998</strong> - Began boxing at 10 years old</li>
          <li>
            <strong>2006</strong> - He won bronze at the AIBA Youth World Boxing
            Championships
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2007</strong> - He won the EU Junior Championship. Moreover,
            in July he won silver at the European Junior Championship
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2008</strong> - He won the ABA super-heavyweight title and
            later in the year turned professional. Furthermore, he married his
            wife Paris
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>2015</strong> - Became World heavyweight Champion after
            beeating Wladimir Klitschko. Fury brilliantly outpointed Klitschko –
            who along with brother Vitali had dominated the heavyweight scene
            for over a decade – in Dusseldorf to win the WBA, WBO and IBF belts.
            It was Klitschko's first defeat in 11 years
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>2016</strong> - He faced accusations of homophobia and
            anti-Semitism. Fury twice pulled out of scheduled rematches with
            Klitschko – in June and September – and announced his retirement in
            October on Twitter before reversing that decision three hours later.
            UK Anti-Doping announced in August that Fury had been serving a
            provisional ban over the "presence of a prohibited substance" – he
            denied ever knowingly committing an anti-doping violation and would
            later receive a backdated two-year ban in December 2017. An
            emotional Fury then opened up on his battle against depression and
            use of cocaine, before voluntarily vacating his WBO and WBA straps
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2017</strong> - Public appearances were limited for Fury in
            2017, who had ballooned to 25 stone during his time out of the ring.
            But there were still plenty of vows to return and dethrone both
            Wilder and domestic rival Anthony Joshua
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2018</strong> - The Gypsy King meakes a comeback to the
            sport. At the end of the year he has a title shot verus Deontay
            Wilder. Those who said Fury was past his best and had opted to fight
            Wilder too soon were made to eat their words as the long-time rivals
            finally squared off in a blockbuster Los Angeles bout. Wilder twice
            sent his opponent to the canvas – the second knockdown followed by a
            remarkable 12th-round recovery from Fury. Although he was
            spectacularly floored, most pundits agreed Fury controlled
            proceedings with a tricky and tactically astute showing and the
            announcement of a split-decision draw was contentious to say the
            least
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2020</strong> - Fury reigns supreme again with an epic TKO
            win in the rematch over Wilder; making him WBC heavyweight champion.
            Fury was the aggressor from the off and put Wilder on the canvas in
            the third and fifth rounds, before the American's corner threw in
            the towel in the seventh to complete one of the greatest comebacks
            boxing, and indeed sport, has ever seen.
